# Housing-Price-Prediction
Housing Prices Prediction  Jul 2019  Project description Competition Description - Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.  Tools used - -> Python – 3.7.2 -> Anaconda Navigator – 1.9.6 -> Jupyter Notebook – 5.7.4  Libraries Used: -> Analyzing: Numpy, Pandas -> Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn -> Modeling: Sci-kit Learn, xgboost  The competition is hosted on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview  My submission is in top 8% with 0.11490 root-mean-squared-error.
